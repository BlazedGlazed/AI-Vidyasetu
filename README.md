# NeighbourShare 
This repo contains our team- 'Py_JACKEL''s official Zonal round competetion.

    2) It has a listing feature where the sellers can list the items to b elnt by their avaliability status.
    3) Sellers can search for the items in a proximity of radius 1 km.
    4) The user uploads an image of the item to be lent and the AI Image Recognition to automatically detect te oblect, categorize it accordingly and suggest at title and/or description        to make the listing feature easier.
    5) An easy to navigate dashboard where the users can request items, set pickup or return dates, and track active loans.
    6) Shows records of history of shared and borrrowed items
    7) Detailed analysis of the user's community contribution like "Money Saved By Borrowing" and "CO2 Emissions Reduced"
